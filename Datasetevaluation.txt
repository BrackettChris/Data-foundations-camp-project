Data set evaluation:
	Regarding the reusability of this data, or R in the FAIR principles, I think this dataset has great potential but could use some improvements. This dataset comes from years of gathering many different variables of data and extensive and meticulous hands-on measurements. I am currently working to take advantage of just some of this database data to create new questions and hypotheses beyond the original scope of the project.
	This database is from the long term ACR experiment based at the USDA ARS Akron research station and includes data from several key variables from 1993 to 2018. Just some of the variables include field operations, yield, daily precipitation, weekly soil moisture across dozens of plots, and Evapotranspiration across many different crop rotations. This database alone, as well as past research it contributed to, could contribute even more to future research questions and can easily be the base for new hypotheses. 
	There is a large amount of valuable information in this database, but some improvements could be made. Since its such a long term study and database, different people have added to it and there are some discrepancies with naming conventions and the database would benefit from some cleaning to prevent less 	wrangling. While there are good field notes and field operation notes, there is also a lack of metadata which would be helpful in explaining the data without having to go out of the way to ask the researchers directly. When I first started working with this database, I had a lot of struggles trying to figure out how much of the data was collected and headaches figuring out how to use this database for our future ideas. I had to get in touch with the original research leader of the station during that experiment in his retirement, who was fortunately able to answer all of my questions. I believe much of this headache could have been prevented with dedicated metadata that goes with the database.
