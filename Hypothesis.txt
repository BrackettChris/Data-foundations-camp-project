Hypothesis:
The data set I am working with is from a long-term agricultural study at Akron research station in Northeastern CO. I am focusing on analysis of yield vs. precip falling from July 16th to August 26th, split between years that had starting water + may precip >250 or <250mm. I will need a plot with lines of best fit, and linear regressions of yieldxprecip as well as yieldxprecip separated by starting water. I'll also need R^2 and equations for each line of best fitMy hypothesis is that when a linear regression is performed between yield and precip between J16 and A26, there will be a high positive correlation because that period of rainfall is important for crop growth. There will also be two distinct groups on the plot since the starting water at planting would also have an effect on yield.
